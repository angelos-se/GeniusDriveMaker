The current shell script used to image drive at workplace has grown so chaotic that no one can meaningfully maintain it any more. (Adding a new DMG file or new model of hard drive means editing the script to take care of something that could have been programmed instead of hard coded...)

So I decided I'd rewrite the script:
1. Using a more maintainable language;
2. Trim the unwanted features;
3. Explore ways of speeding up imaging;
4. And have some funâ€¦

Logic:
0. Check if the prerequisites of the script is met
0.1. Currently there will only be warning if prerequisites are not met
1. Get the list of DMG files in working directory
2. Get the list of connected disks
2.1. Remove the boot drive and internal disk from list
3. Partition & image the disks
3.1. Get the list of partitions
3.2. Compare with DMG list
3.3. Check for missing partitions
3.4. Create required partitions and restore => Back to 3.2

The whole part 3 looks good for parallelization.
